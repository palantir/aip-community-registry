## Install the Package

After upload, you'll need to install the package in your environment. For detailed instructions, see the [official Palantir documentation](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/marketplace/install-product).

The installation process has four main stages:

1. **General Setup**
   - Configure package name
   - Select installation location

2. **Input Configuration**
   - Configure any required inputs. If no inputs are needed, proceed to next step
   - Check project documentation for specific input requirements

3. **Content Review**
   - Review resources to be installed such as Developer Console, the Ontology, and Functions

4. **Validation**
   - System checks for any configuration errors
   - Resolve any flagged issues
   - Initiate installation
